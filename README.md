# Javascript Package Starter

An opinionated approach to modular JavaScript

## Building your package

The following command will trigger [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and build your `src` directory into `lib`.

```
yarn run build
```

## Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test our package. The following command will run the full test suite.

```
yarn run test
```

> You must have [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) installed globally for the `test` command to work.
